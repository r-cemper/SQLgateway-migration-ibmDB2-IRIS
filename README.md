# SQLgateway-migration-MSsql-IRIS #  
Sample repository to show how to migrate from MSsqlserver to InterSystems IRIS    
**using SQLgateway** in contrast to using an external tool as DBeaver or CloudBeaver or similar. 
### Warning ###
This is just JDBC/Java and IRIS with ISOS and SQL 
- no AI, no Python, no other magic

    - Special thanks as this was an excellent base to start off.  
And the [official documentation on SQLgateway](https://docs.intersystems.com/iris20261/csp/docbook/Doc.View.cls?KEY=BSQG_overview)  

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [Docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed.

## Installation 
Clone/git pull the repo into any local directory
```
git https://github.com/r-cemper/SQLgateway-migration-mssql-IRIS.git
```
1. Build
```
docker-compose build
```
2. Run it in foreground. Sometimes container start is slower than estimated.  
```
docker-compose up
```
  - Wait for confirmation from your containers container:  **ready to accept connections**

3.   **Connection to MSsql**: 
        - host: container mssql 
        - database: AdventureWorks 
        - port: 1433 
        - username: SA
        - password: MSSQLServer@2019
4.   **Connection to IRIS**: 
        - host: localhost 
        - namespace: user 
        - port: 41773 
        - username: _SYSTEM 
        - password: SYS
5. **SQLgateway**  
   is installed during Docker build and the required   
   jdbcdriver for Linux is included in this repo   
   
## How to test ##
SMP is available here 
     http://localhost:42773/csp/sys/UtilHome.csp    
     
All migration actions can be executed directly from SMP.   
1. Verify the gateway connection in    
   SMP> Administration> Configuration> Connectivity> SqlGateway_Configuration    
 ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r-cemper/SQLgateway-migration-mssql-IRIS/master/docs/gty01.jpg) 
   - To test Connection click **edit** for connection **mssql**     
   - verify  **Connection successful**      
   - Be patient at this point. Some DB containers take quite some time to talk to you.   
     wait a little bit, reload the page in browser and try the test again. 
   - as you talk to an SQLserver you may access also other available DBs
     by modifying parameter **databaseName=anyDB;**
   
2. Identifying the source tables. In SMP > Change to Namespace USER   
  then step to SMP >Explorers >SQL >Wizards > Data Migration   
  ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r-cemper/SQLgateway-migration-mssql-IRIS/master/docs/gty04.jpg)
  
3. Set required import parameters  
 
  -  Destination Namespace = USER  
  -  Type = TABLE   
  -  Select a SQL Gateway connection: = mssql  ; now the first connection is established and you select 
  -  and you select Schema = [your choice ? ]
  -  Tables to migrate = all   

4. Identify target but you may change the schema to whatever you like   
    starting with **dc_**
  - don't forget to click **change all**    
  - we migrate Definitions and Data so both sides are selected   

5. Skipping special settings, we use defaults to start the task in background      
  ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r-cemper/SQLgateway-migration-mssql-IRIS/master/docs/gty07.jpg) 
  
6. Now we check the results and see everything was working without Errors
  You might see errors if tables depend on content not yet migrated.   
  And wait for completions until the status shows **Done** 
  
7. We terminate the Migration Wizard and return to normal table view filtered by **dc\***
  
  All tables are visible and show meaningful columns
  
8. Selecting a table and clicking on **OpenTable** shows reasonable contents   
  
9. A look into the related generated Class Definitions confirms the result and successful completion.
